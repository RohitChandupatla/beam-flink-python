## What is PageRank in big data?

PageRank (PR) is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank websites in their search engine results. PageRank was named after Larry Page, one of the founders of Google. PageRank is a way of measuring the importance of website pages.

## Importance of flink:
Apache Flink is an excellent choice to develop and run many different types of applications due to its extensive features set. Flink's features include support for stream and batch processing, sophisticated state management, event-time processing semantics, and exactly-once consistency guarantees for state.
